<!-- 
    This example demonstrates a basic HTML5 Boilerplate with a multiline comment (this comment)
    placed at the top, these can appear anywhere within a HTML document, but are not the same
    as PHP comments, which behave in the same was CSS comments do, using // for single line
    comments and /* */ for multiline comments.
